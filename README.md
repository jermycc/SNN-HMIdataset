# SNN-HMI EMG Signal Dataset

## Introduction
This dataset contains Electromyography (EMG) signals collected for the purpose of developing and testing Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) for Human-Machine Interface (HMI) systems. The dataset includes EMG signals for five different hand gestures, with each gesture having 500 training samples and 500 testing samples.

## Dataset Description
Gestures: The dataset includes five distinct hand gestures. Each gesture category is labeled for ease of use.
Samples: Each gesture has 500 training samples and 500 testing samples.
Signal Type: EMG signals were recorded using surface electrodes.
Data Collection: The signals were collected from human subjects performing the specified gestures under controlled conditions.
